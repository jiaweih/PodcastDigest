And so right now I don't really, I can't see any results besides sit there and stare at the log files and look at the request responses, which was a side effect actually of one of our recent changes, is our log files just stopped logging. I got it fixed, but that was funny. So I'm like, wait a second, there aren't any logs. How can the change log not log? Right? It's just like against the laws of nature, essentially. Well, I'm not gonna get blame that one on the air. So I don't wanna embarrass Gerhard, but I fixed it. That's okay, I can't get embarrassed. I can't, because I'm going to learn something new out of this. There you go. So tell me the commit where this was introduced so that I can understand my mistake, seriously. So the code that fixes it is in commit.
