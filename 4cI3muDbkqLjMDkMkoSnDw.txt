work for you? Not easily. I remember I wrote my first product spec and I was very proud of it. I had, you know, I was just on cloud nine kind of with a huge ego saying like I wrote the most comprehensive spec. My head of product called me in his office, says, Bern, this is awful. The engineers hate it. Like why? It's great. They're like, Bern, you designed the whole product for them. Like that's their job. It's not your job to design the product. You have, you know, you have a different job to play now. You're not a software engineer. So that was a hard lesson for me to learn. But the way I dealt with it ultimately is embracing the kinds of products that allow me to exercise those software engineering skills and connect me with software engineers as a fundamental part of my job.
