In this podcast, Cédric de Oliveira and Stéphanie Schuller discuss the dramatic situation in Libya where massive floods have occurred after the passage of cyclone Daniel. The death toll is increasing, with fears that it could reach up to 20,000. The floods destroyed two dams, causing entire streets to be swept away. Climate change expert David Faranda states that these extreme weather events will affect all countries in the Mediterranean region due to the continuing increase in CO2 emissions, which will result in the Mediterranean Sea having more energy, heat, and moisture to create cyclones.
